# script_check_15DEC2016

In the Manuscript, the p-value for the causal OR of fasting glucose on CAD risk in CARDIoGRAMC4D looked too large
so we checked the scripts - no errors detected

the files are:

 cad_fg == Fasting glucose effect per mmol/l from MAGIC (https://www.magicinvestigators.org/downloads/) - published by Scott et al. 2012, PMID  22885924
 cardiogram_fg == genetic associations with CAD risk, downloaded from http://www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/
 Web appendix == Methods/Script appendix from Boweden, Davey-Smith, Burgess 2015, PMID: 26050253
